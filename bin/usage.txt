usage: testling {DIRECTORY|-} {OPTIONS}

If there (is no DIRECTORY and stdin is a tty) or the DIRECTORY is "-",
javascript will be read from stdin and executed.

Otherwise, DIRECTORY (or the $CWD) will be checked for a package.json with a
testling field.

OPTIONS are:

  --bcmd  Launch a browser with an explicit command. By default, chrome or
          firefox is launched by searching your $PATH.

      -u  Instead of launching a browser, print the url to visit so you can open
          the browser yourself.

  --html  Instead of launching a server, show the generated html.
